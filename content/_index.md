### Real wages have been flat for more than 50 years
"Real wages" is a fancy-schmancy economics term for your wages minus inflation

---

### Real Wages per hour since 1964

![real wages since 1964](/images/wages.jpg)

The Average inflation rate since 1964 was 3.87% per year

This does not include inflation from the dark, Covid times (7.4%)

---


This means the average worker has never actually received a meaningful raise in
their entire life

---

### But productivity has increase by 300%
![productivity since 1970](/images/productivity.png)

This means the average worker is either 3x more efficient in the same 40 hours,
or they are working 1/3 of the hours.

---

Are you working 13.33 hours per week right now?

---

### So where did all our productivity go?

---
![ceo pay since 1965](/images/ceo_pay.png)

CEO pay has increased by 351% in that same time

All increases in productivity & then some have been paid out in the salary of
CEOs

## How To Do It

## Caveats
* Your annual raises outpace inflation
* You have vesting schedules or claw-back exemptions for 401k; RSU's; or
  bonuses, the sum of which outpaces inflation
* That's it! If these don't apply to you...
