## The Data is Clear

{{% section %}}

### Real wages have been flat for more than 50 years
"Real wages" is a fancy-schmancy economics term for your wages minus inflation

---

![real wages since 1964](/images/wages.jpg)

Inflation far outpaces raises

---


This means the average worker has never actually received a meaningful raise in
their entire life

---

![productivity since 1970](/images/productivity.png)

But productivity has increase by 300%

---

This means the average worker is either 3x more efficient in the same 40 hours,
or they are working 1/3 of the hours.

---

Are you working 13.33 hours per week right now?

---

So where did all our productivity go?

---
![ceo pay since 1965](/images/ceo_pay.png)

CEO pay has increased by 351% in that same time

---

All increases in productivity & then some have been paid out in the salary of
CEOs for our entire lives

## How To Do It

{{% section %}}

---

### Know your worth

Figure out what the average person gets paid for the same position in your area

Good sites to use are
[glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com),
[levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi),
& [blind](https://www.teamblind.com/)

---

### Update your resume, portfolio website, linkedin, etc.

This awakens the bots of the internet & puts you on recruiter's radar

It Helps you realize how far you've come & that you are worth more than you are
currently paid

---

### Apply like crazy

You have an 8.3% chance of getting an offer from a single job application
[[link]](https://www.hirelehigh.com/post/how-many-applications-does-it-take-to-get-a-job)

So apply to 200+ jobs.

Don't be discouraged. Every rejection is practice for the next potential position

---

### Always negotiate your starting salary

Only 39% of workers negotiate their salary
[[link]](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/only-39-percent-of-workers-negotiated-their-salary-at-their-last-job-offer.html)

The average negotiator earns 13.3% more
[[link]](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/if-you-dont-negotiate-salary-you-could-lose-7500-a-year-glassdoor.html)

Never give your salary first. If asked, push the question back to them & ask for
their position's salary range.

---

### Don't take the counter-offer!
Be wary. They could be using it to make you stay just long enough to find your
replacement.

If they had the budget to give you a counter-offer to stay, why didn't they just
give you that money during your last review? This shows they know you are worth
more than you are being paid.

---

### Compare apples to apples

Always compare Total Compensation (TC)
* Salary
* Healthcare Benefits, especially HSAs
* 401k Matching
* RSUs

All benefits have a dollar amount. Figure it out

Always go remote if possible. No more wasting time commuting to an office

{{% /section %}}

---
## Caveats
* Your annual raises outpace inflation
* You have vesting schedules or claw-back exemptions for 401k; RSU's; or
  bonuses, the sum of which outpaces inflation
* That's it! If these don't apply to you...
